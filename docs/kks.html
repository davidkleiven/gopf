            <p class="paragraph">The Kim-Kim-Suzuki model is a method for modeling multiphase
                systems. A defining feature of the model is that the free energies are described
                by individual concentrations <strong>in each phase</strong> and order parameters.
                The different phases co-exist on each "pixel" of the domain, and thus the chemical
                potential in each co-existing phase is equal. Here, we will go through the theory
                for two phases, labeled <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i>. A schematical illustration
                of the free energies is shown below.

                In the following we denote the concentration in the <i>&alpha;</i>-phase <i>c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and 
                the concentration in the <i>&beta;</i>-phase <i>c<sub>&beta;</sub></i>. The total free energy

                Furthermore, the concentration at a point in space is given by the weighted

                We want to know the time evolution of the total concentration <i>c</i> and the field <i>&phi;</i>

                We therefore need partial derivatives of <i>f</i> with respect to the total concentraion <i>c</i>
                and <i>&phi;</i>. Thus, <i>c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and <i>c<sub>&beta;</sub></i> are functions
                of the variables <i>c</i> and <i>&phi;</i>. To evaluate the functional derivatives, the partial
                derivatives of <i>c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and <i>c<sub>&beta;</sub></i> with respect to <i>c</i>,
                when <i>&phi;</i> and with respect to <i>&phi;</i> when <i>c</i> is fixed, are needed. When the
                concentration in the two phases changes by a small amount (<i>c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i>&#8594;
                <i>c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> + <i>&Delta;c<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and

                <i>c<sub>&beta;</sub></i> + <i>&Delta;c<sub>&beta;</sub></i>), the equation relating the 
                the chemical potentials in the two phases can be expanded to first order in the changes

                <i>&Delta;c<sub>&alpha;</sub>/&Delta; c</i> and <i>&Delta;c<sub>&beta;</sub>/&Delta; c</i>.

                We proceed in a similar manner to find the partial derivatives with respect to <i>&phi;</i>,

                phases when <i>&phi;</i> changes by a small amount, such that <i>c</i> remains unchanged.

            <h3>Interface Profile</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In this section we explore the interface profile of the KKS model. A sketch 
                of how the volume fraction <i>&phi;</i> changes across an interface is shown 
                below

            <p class="paragraph">
                An important feature of the KKS is model is that the concentrations in the 
                to phases does not change across an interface. However, the total concentration 
                <i>c</i> can change because the volume fraction of phase <i>&alpha;</i> and 
                <i>&beta;</i> changes. Consequently, the excess energy associated with an interface
                is independendent of <i>f<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>&beta;</sub></i>. The only
                remaining part of the overall free energy density is

                We can now match the interface energy <i>&sigma;</i> of a sharp interface with the 
                energy of a diffuse interface via

                where the dependence on <i>&phi;'</i> has explicitly been included in the integrand.
                To solve the integral, we need to know the profile <i>&phi;(x)</i>. This is done 
                be seeking a stationary profile (e.g. <i>&delta;&sigma; = 0</i>).

                which we recognize as the Euler-Lagrange equation. By substituting 
                <i>d/d&phi; = dx/d&phi; d/dx</i> and multiplying both sides with <i>dx/d&phi;</i> we 
                arrive at

                as <i>&phi; &#8594;, 1</i> <i>g &#8594; 0 </i> and <i>&phi;' &#8594; 0</i>. Thus,
                the integration constant above has to be zero. By replacing <i>&phi;'</i> in the integral 
                and introducing the substitution <i>dx = d&phi;dx/d&phi;</i> we finally arrive at

            <p class="paragraph">
                The next (and very important) step is to determine how the width of the diffuse interface 
                depends on the parameters <i>W</i> and <i>&gamma;</i>. In other words, we need to solve the
                first order differential equation

            <h3>Specializing The Model</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In this section we introduce concrete expressions for the free energies and finally end up
                with a closed form system of equations that can be solved numerically. We will use two 
                parabolic functions for the free energies
