            <p class="paragraph">This example goes through the basic theory behind Shrinking Dimer Dynamics (SDD),
                as well as application for identifying the critical droplet size for heterogenous nucleation.
                Several phase field equations are derived from a an energy functional that depends on a set
                of fields <i>&phi;<sub>i</sub></i>.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/sdd/energyFunc.svg" height="48px"/>

            <p class="paragraph">
                where <i>f({&phi;<sub>i</sub>})</i> is a bulk energy density that depends on all the fields, and
                <i>&gamma;<sub>i</sub></i> are gradient coefficients that adds an energy penalty for forming interfaces
                between the various fields. From the energy functional we can define a generalized force acting on the field
                as the functional derivative of the energy with respect to each field. Furthermore, if we define the equation
                motion such that the field evolves in the direction of the negative gradient of the force, the fields will eventually
                end up in a local minimum.
            </p>

            <p class ="paragraph">
                where <i>L</i> is a constant that controls how rapidly the field changes. For several applications, the local
                energy minimum is not the most interesting solution, but rather the saddle points. By introducing a small change
                to the equation of motion above, we can get the fields to evolve towards a saddle point instead. First, we 
                introduce an "unstable" direction <b>v</b>. The reason why it is called "unstable" will become clear later.
                We want the system to move along the <i>positive</i> force direction parallel to <b>v</b> and along the negative
                force in all other directions. For simplivity we label the generalized force <b>q</b> in the following. The component
                of <b>q</b> on along <b>v</b> is given by <b>q<sub>&parallel;</sub></b> = <b>vv<sup>T</sup>q</b>. We can, thus, flip
                the sign of the component of the force along <b>v</b>, while leaving the other directions unchanged, by appliying the
                operation <i>I - 2</i><b>vv<sup>T</sup></b> to the force vector. Thus, the equation of motion for the field becomes
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The "unstable" direction <b>v</b> is still unknown. However, we can find an equation of motion such that it aligns
                with the underlying unstable direction. First, we calculate the generalized force at two shifted positions
                <b>q<sub>1</sub></b> = <b>q</b>({&phi;<sub>i</sub>} - <i>0.5l</i><b>v</b>) and <b>q<sub>2</sub></b> = <b>q</b>({&phi;<sub>i</sub>} + <i>0.5l</i><b>v</b>),
                where <i>l</i> is the length. If we now imagine that the dimer is a "rod" of length <i>l</i> and orientation <b>v</b>, we can calculate the 
                torque acting on the rod.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The component of <v>q<sub>1</sub></v> acting in the anti-clockwise direction is <b>q<sub>&perp;,1</sub></b> = 
                <i>(I - </i><b>vv<sup>T</sup></b>)<b>q<sub>1</sub></b> and similar for for <b>q<sub>2</sub></b>. The net force along
                the anti-clockwise direction is given by the difference between <b>q<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>q<sub>1</sub></b> since they
                act on different ends. The final equation of motion for the orientation vector <b>v</b> is thus,

            <p class="paragraph">
                where <i>&tau;</i> is an artificial time constant controlling how quickly the orientation vector responds to the applie torque.
                The last step, is to define an equation for the length of the dimer. For convergence, it is important that the length shrinks
                to zero as the time approaches infinity [1]. We adopt the following equation for the dimer length

            <h3> Application To Heterogeneous Nucleation</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
            As an example case, we apply the approach outlined above to solve the problem initially studied by Zhang <i>et al.</i> [2].
            We consider a model that has two stable phases <i>&phi;=-1</i> and <i>&phi; = 1</i>. The functional at hand is
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">The generalized force is therefore given by</p>

            <img src="assets/sdd/force.svg" height="48px"/>

            <p class="paragraph">The function <i>&theta;</i> describes an inhomogeneity and is here given by</p>

            <img src="assets/sdd/theta.svg" height="48px"/>

            <p class="paragraph">where <i>&alpha;=0.99</i> is used in the present case. The effect of the inhomogeneity is that
            any variation in the field <i>&phi;</i> "costs" less energy if it happens at the inhomogeneity. By starting the system from
            a small semi-circle located at the inhomogeneity, we can evolve the equations until it stops at the saddle point.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                We observe that the critical size of the droplet is affected by the inhomogeneity and is clearly not circular as it would
                be if there was no inhomogeneity present.
